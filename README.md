<summary>important</summary>

i am diagnosed with [bpd](https://bpdresources.carrd.co/). this affects every aspect of my relationships with people. read the linked carrd and educate yourself before trying to get close. i am mentally ill and very very paranoid, jealous and selfish, and im afraid i may be manipulative. interact with caution at all times. i would say more, but this section would get too long if i did. please just read the carrd, or if youre feeling lazy, at least check out the [glossary.](https://bpdresources.carrd.co/#glossary) dont interact with me if you cant bother to read a little to understand why i may act the way i do.

i am the host of a willogenic system, formed through [tulpamancy](https://tulpas.carrd.co/). i am NOT the system creator. i am NOT pro-endo or anti-endo. i want to stay out of "syscourse" - i dont want to get in arguments about whether im allowed to exist or not. if you are "anti-endo", just dont interact with me. i cannot stress how much i hate "syscourse" or how insulting it is. we are not a disordered system and we dont know what its like to be you, but you dont know what its like to be us, either. so dont assume.

i am [proship](https://proshipresourcesaccessible.carrd.co/), among other things. our system is collectively profic. i am personally a darkshipper and shotacon. ill say one thing: i have never felt safer and more loved and accepted in a community than in the proship community. we arent creeps, we arent weirdos. we are people who want to enjoy tabboo fiction and have every right to do so. antis educate yourselves before interacting with me, or you give me no reason to even consider listening to you. (also please check out the linked carrd! it was made by a very awesome and respectable person and took a lot of time and effort to make!)
