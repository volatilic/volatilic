<summary>important</summary>

i am diagnosed with [bpd](https://bpdresources.carrd.co/). this affects every aspect of my relationships with people. we recently had an extreme bpd episode and lost a lot of friends. were still recovering. im extremely paranoid at the moment and am struggling to continue connecting with people after that. interact with EXTREME caution and avoid confrontation as much as possible. im willing to talk to and be friendly with people but im terrified of getting *too close* to anyone for the time being.

also irl stuff is shit and system stuff is a LOT right now, so we wont be NEARLY as active on pony town and online in general as we used to be. (used to have sup t4 and sit afk 24/7 :'3 ~~i miss my supporter~~)

also *also*! i unfortunately may have to clarify this, but if there are any *genuine* pedophile allegations against *anyone* in our system, they are NOT true?? NONE of us are pedophiles. i apologize sincerely on the behalf of any of our system members who may have hurt anyone. the past few months have been a very complicated time for us and we may have acted very much in the wrong. but that does not excuse any problematic behavior from us. thank you for reading and PLEASE dont spread rumors just because we are proship!
